Create a list of aura categories defined min and max values for each measurement factors (i.e valence, energy, tempo, and danceability).
Then take an average of the top 100 songs' values for each the factors to determine the category aura that the user falls into.
The way this aura is calculated might not be very representative of the listener because it does not factor the time. For example,
a user may listen to songs at the beginning of the year that accounts for majority of their songs, but towards the end of the year
they switch to a different style of songs.  The more recent songs should have a higher weight as it would represent a more
current mood and aura of the person that the songs played earlier in the year.
